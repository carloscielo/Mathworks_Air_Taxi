Electric Aircraft VTOL Component Sizing
Copyright 2017-2020 The MathWorks, Inc.

These example models enable you to use simulation to evaluate electric 
and hybrid VTOL electric aircrafts against design criteria such
as flight range and flight duration.  The models are parameterized so
that you can modify many aspects of the design, including automatic
parameter sweeps of battery size and payload.
