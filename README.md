These example models enable you to use simulation to evaluate electric 
and hybrid electric aircraft architectures against design criteria such 
as flight range and flight duration. The models are parameterized so that 
you can modify many aspects of the design. MATLAB code automates parameter 
sweeps of battery size and payload. Using these models of electric aircraft 
in Simulink, you can rapidly explore the design space to identify ranges 
that meet system requirements. Models include a fixed wing and a VTOL aircraft 
in separate folders.
