# **Electric Aircraft Model in Simscape&trade;**
Copyright 2023 The MathWorks, Inc.

These example models enable you to use simulation to evaluate electric 
and hybrid electric architectures against design criteria such as flight 
range and maximum flight time. The models are parameterized so that you 
can modify many aspects of the design, including automatic parameter sweeps 
of battery size and payload.

Open Airtaxi_Wing.prj to get started.
